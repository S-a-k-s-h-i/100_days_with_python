Python | Merging two Dictionaries

** in Python 
 
This is generally considered a trick in Python where a single expression is used to merge two dictionaries and stored in a third dictionary. The single expression is **. This does not affect the other two dictionaries. ** implies that an argument is a dictionary. Using ** [double star] is a shortcut that allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function directly using a dictionary.

Input:
Length of dictionary1 2
length of dictionary2 2
a 10
b 8
dictionary1 =  {'b': 8, 'a': 10}
d 6
c 4
dictionary2 =  {'d': 6, 'c': 4}

Output:
{'b': 8, 'd': 6, 'c': 4, 'a': 10}
