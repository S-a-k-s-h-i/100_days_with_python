Python program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval

Given two positive integer start and end. The task is to write a Python program toprint all Prime numbers in an Interval.

Definition: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

The idea to solve this problem is to iterate the val from start to end using a for loop and for every number, if it is greater than 1, check if it divides n. If we find any other number which divides, print that value.

Example 1:
3 20
3 7 11 13 17 19

Example 2:
11 25
11 13 17 19 23
